# Backlog

Planned work that is not built yet. Newest first. Move an item out of here (into the user guide and the
changelog) when it ships.

* **Work on a repository on another computer over SSH** (low priority). Run git on the other machine through
  `ssh host git -C <path> …` so the app can open its working tree directly. Today an SSH *remote* plus a local clone
  works; this would add remote execution, polling instead of the file watcher, and handling of latency.

## Shipped

The five items requested in November 2026 are built: history filters (author, commit, date), the Sync subs
drop-down with **Sync and pull**, tab bar scrolling and narrower tabs, double-click a commit to check it out, and
sidebar sections collapsed by default and remembered per tab. They are described in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`.

The twelve items requested later in November 2026 are built too: closing a terminal group closes just that group, closing a
terminal ends its whole process tree, terminal scrolling fix, closing a tab returns to the previous tab, a tab right-click
menu, submodule tabs grouped with their parent, clicking a branch selects its latest commit, recent and most-used commit
messages, a clearer push dialog, and **Sync and bump pointers**. They are described in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`.
